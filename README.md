# Website Using Python
In this project we are going to create a website using Python. yes you heard it right. Python has capability to create a website.
I used many modules such as streamlit, pillow, requests and streamlit_lottie. All these can help us to create a beautiful website.  
You can crreate your webasite using this as a base and then don,t forget to mention me on your github.  
I am personally inspired by @Sven-Bo. All credits goes to him.  
Don't forget to add all thses folders in same directory and kindly store congi.toml file in a folder name ```.streamlit``` and then this folder should in the same directory with others.  
Paste these syntax to install modules in your pc:  
```pip install streamlit```  
```pip install Pillow```  
```pip install requests```  
```pip install streamlit-lottie```
